Hi. This is the content and code for my blog.

Here's what it does:

- GNU M4 macro processor for expanding HTML snippets
- Pandoc for converting from markdown to HTML
- Lua to glue everything together, light and fast
- A little JS for tag filtering cause I don't want more pages
- Finally, a bash script for building posts and deploying
